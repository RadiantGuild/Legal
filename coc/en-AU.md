# CONTENT & CODE OF CONDUCT POLICY
This policy will define the code of conduct and content restrictions that the administration of the Radiant Guild platform expects all users and artists to follow at all times. Failure to follow the policy will in most situations result in a warning before actions like suspension or termination are taken. However in extreme circumstances we may suspend or terminate an account without notice in line with our Terms of Service.

## 1. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
This code of conduct policy may change at any time and become effective immediately without notice. Please stay up to date with this policy occasionally. We will endeavour to give notice for more fundamental or major changes where appropriate.

## 2. SOCIAL INTERACTIONS & COMMUNICATION
### 2.1. Political Content
While our rules don’t disallow political comments, political content must be constructive, must not take shots at any opposing political views, and must follow our content policy. Political content must not fester into pointless arguments, toxic behaviour or threats.  
When making political content, you must be able to accept that others have different views, and that you might not always agree with those views.  
It’s important to remember that the platform is an art platform, not a political debate forum. We reserve the right to take any action on anything that becomes politically charged if needed.

### 2.2. Harassment, Bullying and Discrimination
We do not allow any user to make content or use communication features to harass, bully, intimidate, discriminate, mock or make fun of another person regardless if that person is on or off the platform.
### 2.3. Threats of Violence and Doxing
We will not tolerate any behaviour that is threatening, including threats of violence or doxing another person, serious or not, regardless of if that person is on or off platform. Doxing (publishing identifying information about another person on or off platform) will not be tolerated. Violations may result in immediate account termination.
### 2.4. Malware, Trackers and Account Stealing
We will not tolerate any users who engage in any form of malware spreading campaign, any user who attempts to steal another user’s account, or otherwise engages in activities that risks a user’s privacy. All violations of this rule will result in account suspension or termination immediately.
### 2.5. Blocking
Users who block another user must not attempt to communicate with the blocked user, and users may not act as a proxy to circumvent a block. Blocks must not be abused to communicate with another user while preventing communication from that user.

Block evasion (any attempt to circumvent a block as the blocking user, blocked user or a user acting as proxy between a blocker and a blocked user) will not be tolerated.

## 3. CONTENT ORIGINALITY
Content published to the platform must be your original works. Republishing with permission of the original artist(s) is acceptable in cases where the permission can be shown to site administration on request.

## 4. AI GENERATED CONTENT
Posts containing AI-generated content are not allowed at this time and posts proven to contain it will be deleted after moderation contact with the poster.  
We don't prohibit tools that use AI (Content aware selection for example) but the image can't be generated.

## 5. MATURE CONTENT
Maturity flags are content warnings that the platform provides for artists to warn users when content contains things that may not be suitable for everyone. As such artists are expected to flag their content with the appropriate maturity flags.
### 5.1. Violence
Any content that contains physical violence in any form (for example fist fights) must be flagged with the Violence maturity flag. This also includes fantasy violence, for example magic or special abilities. Encouraging or promoting violence is strictly prohibited in all circumstances.
### 5.2. Drug Use / Drug reference
Any content that contains drug use or references to drugs must be flagged with the “Drug Use” maturity flag and it must not endorse or encourage such use. Illegal, illicit or potentially dangerous drugs may only be used for story plot in a creative work provided it’s clear those drugs are discouraged.
### 5.3. Nudity
Nudity (content depicting a character with features like nipples or genitals) must be flagged with the “Nudity” maturity flag. All characters in the piece must be clearly above the age of maturity. Content that contains sexual context, arousal or explicit sexual activities is prohibited.
### 5.4. Sexual Implications
Content that makes subtle implications or vague mentions to sexual activities may only be posted provided it has been marked with the “Sexual” maturity flag. Content that contains fetishes or explicit sexual activity is prohibited.

## 6. PROHIBITED CONTENT
