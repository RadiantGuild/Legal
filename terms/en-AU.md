1. You may have the option to require payment from Supporters in exchange for access to particular Content through the Platform. In relation to any such payment (**Pledge**), you must specify:
    1. if the Pledge is one-off or subscription-based, and if subscription-based, the terms of such subscription (including frequency of payment);

5. After the Third Party Payment Provider receives payment of the Pledge Amount from a Supporter from your Account, we will ensure that the Third Party Payment Provider transfers the Pledge Amount to you, minus the Service Fee and the Transaction Fee (**Remaining Balance**), within a reasonable time.

6. The Third Party Payment Provider may hold the Remaining Balance for a reasonable period after receiving it from a Supporter (**Holding Period**). For the purposes of this clause, you understand and agree that 14 days is a reasonable period unless there is a dispute in respect of the Remaining Balance, in which case we reserve the right to extend the Holding Period indefinitely until such dispute is resolved.

7. You understand and agree that if, during the Holding Period:
    1. you cancel your Account; or

(**Automatic Recurring Billing**) If your Pledge is made by way of a subscription, your Pledge will continue to renew on a monthly or annual basis indefinitely (depending on your selection), and you must pay Pledge Amounts in respect of each period, unless you notify us prior to the expiry of the then current month or year that you want to cancel your Pledge. Otherwise, we will continue to debit the Pledge Amounts from your account each month. We will not pay any charge back amount if you fail to cancel your Pledge in accordance with this clause. By choosing a recurring Pledge, you acknowledge that your Pledge has an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to your cancellation of your Pledge. We may submit periodic charges for the Pledge Amounts without further authorisation from you, until you provide prior written notice (receipt of which is confirmed by us) that you have terminated this authorisation or wish to change your payment method. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before we could reasonably act on such notice. To terminate your authorisation or change your payment method, please contact us via our Platform.

4. (**Service Fees**) You acknowledge and agree that for payments made to Creators, we may deduct a Service Fee, and the Third Party Payment Provider’s Transaction Fee from the Pledge Amount, before transferring the Remaining Balance to the relevant Creator. The Pledge Amounts are inclusive of our Service Fees.

6. (**Changing or waiving Pledge Amounts**) We reserve the right to refund, change or waive Pledge Amounts at any time.

8. (**Currency**) All Pledge Amounts and amounts are in US dollars, unless otherwise specified. If you choose to pay any Pledge Amount in a foreign currency (not being US dollars), then the Third Party Payment Provider will convert the amount you pay to US dollars, in accordance with their then current policies, procedures and legal terms.

9. (**Payments to us**) If Radiant Guild requires payment for access to certain Content or Services from time to time, these payment terms will also apply to any such payments.
