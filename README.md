# Legal
This repository contains the legal documents for the Radiant Guild.

## Disclamer
While you may be agreeing to the legal documents held in this repository as part of your use of the Radiant Guild's platform. The final version of these documents must be sourced from the website's relevant page.

## Purpose
We decided to house the legal documents in this github repository for the following reasons
1. **History** - Any and all changes we make to the legal docuemnts will be forever visible here in this repository
2. **Easy Comparing** - If you would like to see what specifically was changed in any given revision(s), then you can use the inbuilt diff tools to see changes
3. **Reviewing** - So the platform administration team can publish planned changes and accept comments from team members and users alike.

## Translation
These legal documents will only be avaliable in Australian English `en-AU` for the time being, that said we plan to eventually have them localised into whatever languages we can down the road. Stay tuned.
