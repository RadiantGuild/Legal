# Privacy Policy & Cookies Policy
We care about your privacy. And no, we promise this is not some stupid PR speak for “We say we care but really we just want to sell your data and don’t want to admit it”. So we are going to write this policy in a way that you can easily read, and strict enough that we as a platform can’t do anything this policy does not allow.

## 2. APPLICATION OF THIS POLICY
This policy sets out the privacy policy of Tasman Miles Leach ABN 96 591 337 824 operating under the business name Radiant Guild (referred to in this privacy policy as ‘Radiant Guild’, ‘we’, ‘us’, or ‘our’).

## 4. HOW WE COLLECT YOUR DATA
We collect data either directly from you (or from third parties as set out in 3.4 above), including where you:

1. provide data to us; 

2. communicate with us via our platform, social media applications or otherwise; or

3. register with or link an external service to your Radiant Guild account. 

## 5. HOW WE USE YOUR DATA
### 5.1. INTRO
We primarily use the data provided to us to provide you with the service we offer. Yes, that phrase is a bit vague so let's break down what our service does, how it uses it and all that.

### 5.2. ANALYTICS DATA
We collect some basic analytics data, all of this analytics data is anonymized and we as a platform are unable to link analytics data with individual users. The purpose of this analytics data is to help us improve the platform. For example, we will collect screen sizes so that we can take the common sizes and use them as part of testing and designing. We will also collect user agent strings so that we can understand better what kinds of devices are used when viewing the Radiant Guild, are you using a phone? Are you on a tablet? A desktop maybe? What browsers and versions are being used?

### 5.3. ACCOUNT INFORMATION
Account information is data regarding your identity on our platform and for the most part is kept private within the Radiant Guild system. We also strongly believe that the best way to keep user data safe is by not having that user data. So we will never ever ask you for your real name, date of birth, or other personal information. The only data that we need is your email address so that we can communicate with you and configure an account. Along with your email address you need to provide one of either a password that we store with a one way hashing algorithm so that none of the Radiant Guild staff members can see your password, or link to a third party identity provider like Discord, GitHub, GitLab and Patreon

**Note about passwords**: While we at the Radiant Guild do our best to secure your password, we would like to make it clear that storing a password hash after passing it through a one way algorithm to prevent people from knowing what it was before the hash is still at risk of being dehashed. Someone with a powerful machine and time can bruteforce a hash and uncover what it was. So we advise all users who use a password to please use a password manager and use randomly generated passwords.

### 5.4. PROFILE INFORMATION
Profile information is all the data that represents you as a person on the internet, and this data is by default public unless you adjust your privacy settings. If you make your profile private, then nobody other than you and administrators will be able to see your profile. Profile information includes your display name, your bio, banner and avatar along with any comments in public places or posts made to the platform.

### 5.5. EXTERNAL IDENTITY PROVIDERS
External Identity Providers are external platforms, services or systems that you may have an account with, when you link an identity provider with your Radiant Guild account, you are delegating us as a platform access to limited sets of data on that platform and in some rare cases that is not currently implemented, granting us permission to perform limited sets of actions on your account. Currently the Radiant Guild does not perform any action on any linked external platform, however this may change in the future. This access you grant us is revocable at any time by unlinking those platforms from your account in the account settings page, however to fully revoke our access, you will need to revoke our access from the platform in question. If you need help, feel free to contact us.

The privileges that the Radiant Guild gets with this delegation is outlined in “External Identity Provider Delegated Permissions” at 3.4.

### 5.6. OTHER USES
We may also collect and use your data for the following purposes:

1. for record keeping & administrative purposes; 
2. to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or enforce our agreements with third parties; 
3. where we have your consent, including to send you approved marketing and promotional messages (which you can opt-out of at any time, for example by way of an unsubscribe link; and
4. for our legitimate interests including:
    1. to develop and carry out marketing activities and to conduct market research and analysis and develop statistics;
    2. to improve and optimise our service offering and customer experience;
    3. to send you administrative messages, reminders, notices, updates and other information requested by you;
    4. to consider an application of employment from you; and

2. disclosures required by law or regulation; and

3. service providers and other affiliated third parties to enable us to provide our services to you including other professional advisers such as accountants, or auditors and/or overseas counsel.

However, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data.

### 13.4. LOCAL STORAGE & SESSION STORAGE
Radiant Guild makes use of mechanisms intended to store some information about the user or the session on your local machine for the purposes of handling application state. The information stored here is never transmitted. However in some cases like an email address, that information may be stored in Radiant Guild’s servers to provide the service, but generally local / session storage is used to store things like if your account has been set up fully or the url to return you to after completing a login.

All information stored in this mechanism is detailed below

**Note**: An “*” (Asterisk) is a placeholder and could be anything, generally an asterisk is just some ID used by the application.

### 13.5. HOW LONG WILL COOKIES REMAIN ON MY DEVICE?
The amount of time that a cookie remains on your computer or device depends on the type of cookie – cookies are either “persistent” or “session” cookies. Persistent cookies last until they expire or are deleted, so they may remain on your device for as little as 10 minutes to several years. Session cookies last until you stop browsing, so just for the relevant session.

### 13.6. HOW DO I CONTROL COOKIES?
1. Usually, you can control and manage cookies through your browser. You can control whether or not your browser accepts cookies, how to filter and manage cookies, and how to delete cookies at the end of a session.
